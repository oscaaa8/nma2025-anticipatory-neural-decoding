# nma2025-anticipatory-neural-decoding
A data-driven analysis of state encoding in cortical circuits using open calcium imaging datasets. Neuromatch Academy 2025 project analyzing anticipatory activity in mouse visual cortex using calcium imaging and Cohen’s d.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of [Neuromatch Academy 2025](https://neuromatch.io) and explores how anticipatory states are encoded in the visual cortex of mice navigating a virtual environment. Using large-scale calcium imaging data from Zhong et al. (2025), we extract and compare anticipatory vs. non-anticipatory neural activity aligned to reward licking behavior.

## 📊 Key Features

- Behavioral trial cleaning using lick-aligned events
- Frame-matched calcium imaging data analysis
- Neuronal selectivity analysis using Cohen’s d
- Visualization of population-wide anticipatory bias
